# movie_app_test

This is a Flutter app that retrieves popular movies from The Movie Database API and displays them in a list. Users can tap on a movie to view its details, including its synopsis, release date, and rating.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, you'll need to obtain an API key from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). Once you have your API key, create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and add the following line:

```
api_key=<your_api_key_here>
```

This will allow the app to access the API and retrieve movie data.

## Running the App

To run the app, make sure you have Flutter installed on your system. Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:

```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

This will launch the app on your device or emulator.
